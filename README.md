## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

-   Node.js (v14 or newer)
-   npm or yarn
-   Python (v3.8 or newer)
-   pip
-   MongoDB


## How to Start the Application
**1. Build a virtual environment (recommended)** 

Below demonstrates python venv, while other virtual environment alternatives also work.
```
# In the root folder of this repository
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
**2. Upgrade pip (optional)**
```
# [Optional] Upgrade your pip
pip install --upgrade pip
```
**3. Install backend requirements and run the backend service**
```
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```
The backend server will start running on `http://localhost:5000`.

**Troubleshoot:** if the `flask run` method is not successful, try `python app.py` instead.

**4. Install frontend packages and run the frontend service**

Please open another terminal at the root directory and activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate`
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
**5. Go to `localhost:3000` to access the service**
